Subject: Request for Permission to Conduct Blockchain MasterClass at MITADT University

Dear Head of Department CSE MITSOC,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Prathmesh Vankore and I am the Co-Founder of DApp World. We are a company that specializes in providing education and training on the latest trends and technologies in the blockchain industry.

We are writing to request your permission to conduct a Blockchain MasterClass at MITADT University on 27th January 2022. The class will be a comprehensive program that will introduce students and professionals to the fundamental concepts and practical applications of blockchain technology. The class will be conducted by me and two of your students Fuzail Kazi (TY-NS) and Atharva Borkar (SY-5) who have experience in the field and have worked on several successful projects with DApp World.

We believe that this class will be of great benefit to the students and faculty of MITADT University, as it will provide them with the knowledge and skills they need to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain technology. Additionally, we believe that this class will help to establish MITADT University as a leader in blockchain education and research.

We understand that you are busy, and we would be happy to arrange a meeting with you to discuss this further. We would like to inform you that Fuzail Kazi from TY-NS is our contact person from the University and he will be coordinating with us on this. Please let us know if this is something that interests you and if you would like to schedule a meeting.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Prathmesh Vankore
Co-Founder,
